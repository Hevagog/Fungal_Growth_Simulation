Growth is based on two mechanisms:
* Elongation of each hypha
* Their multiplication by successive branching. \
Those mechanisms could be localized only at the tip of the hyphae. \
Branching can be of two types:
* apical
* lateral
Branching depends on its localization on the hyphae.

Minimal model: Can be used for Neurospora crassa
* nutrient supply rate
* growth rate at the tip
* branching rate
* flow rate of nutrients \
In this minimal model material necessary for growth of the hyphae is packaded as vesicles and supplied by a single source
